Never forget what you are, for surely the world will not.
Make it your strength. Then it can never be your weakness.
Armor yourself in it, and it will never be used to hurt you.

The common people pray for rain, healthy children, and a summer that never ends.
It is no matter to them if the high lords play their game of thrones.
So long as they are left in peace. They never are.

Always keep your foes confused.
If they are never certain who you are or what you want,
they cannot know what you are like to do next.
Sometimes the best way to baffle them is to make moves that have no purpose,
or even seem to work against you
